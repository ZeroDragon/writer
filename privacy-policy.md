# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 13, 2026**

Writeros ("the App") is developed by Carlos Flores ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use Writeros on iOS, macOS, or the web.

## Summary

**Writeros does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.** Your content stays on your device.

## Information We Do Not Collect

Writeros is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Usage or analytics data
- Location data
- Device identifiers or fingerprints
- Crash reports or diagnostics
- Cookies or tracking technologies

## Your Content

All documents, notes, and content you create in Writeros are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your content, and it is never transmitted to our servers.

## Third-Party Services

### Apple App Store & RevenueCat

Writeros offers a one-time in-app purchase through Apple's App Store. We use RevenueCat to manage purchase validation. When you make a purchase:

- The transaction is processed entirely by Apple. We do not receive or store your payment information (credit card, billing address, etc.).
- RevenueCat receives an anonymous transaction receipt from Apple to validate your purchase. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email, or other personal information from us.
- For more information, see [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) and [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

## Children's Privacy

Writeros is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since the App does not collect any personal data, no special data handling is required.

## Data Security

Because Writeros does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no risk of your personal information being exposed through our systems. Your content remains on your device under your control.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data for us to access, correct, or delete. You maintain full control of your content on your device at all times.

Under applicable laws, including Mexico's Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares (LFPDPPP) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to:

- Access any personal data we hold about you (we hold none)
- Request correction or deletion of your data
- Object to or restrict data processing
- Data portability

For users in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides additional rights. Since we do not collect personal information, these rights are inherently satisfied.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
